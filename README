OE Signatures
-------------

This bitbake layer (OpenEmbedded Overlay) exists to test some code which I've
thrown together.  This code changes the way variables are expanded, to allow
more information to be retained easily about what it references.  It also adds
tracking of what shell functions are called by other shell functions, and what
variables are used from the metadata by python code.

There are multiple purposes of this, but the most immediate is to implement
intelligent signature/hash generation of the metadata (or chunks of the
metadata).  This is necessary in order to provide sane binary caching support,
and in the future, will allow bitbake to move away from the "stamp" concept
entirely, instead relying on tracking of the input and output of tasks, and
the pieces of the metadata they use.

Next, this should allow us, in the long term, to allow one to edit a
configuration file without reparsing the world.  Of course, Holger's ast work
is a step in the right direction for that also, but this would allow us to
bypass re-execution of the ast statements as well, simply letting 'dirty'
state information flow through the variable references.
